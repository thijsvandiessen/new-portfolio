			<h1>Simple blog</h1>
		</div>

		<p>To gain some experience in Wordpress, I created a simple blog for my mother. With this site she can share her observations as a beekeeper with her students and other interested beekeepers.</p>

		<p>To create an online identity for my mother, I chose to design a logo that can be used on her pots of honey and the other bee products she sells. It also has a permanent place on the website. In my eyes, good logos are always simple, so that they can be recognised and reproduced. Therefore the challenge was to convey the experience of a bee in the most minimalistic way as possible. The pointed shape of the logo, which creates movement, allowed me to even eliminate the wings of the bee while still keeping it recognisable through itâ€™s stripes.</p>

		<p>For a friend of mine I designed a logo for his DJ-practices in the underground music scene of Amsterdam. I tried to design something that is attractive to his target group and that his guests can identify with. This turns out to have worked, and he is very proud of it. Ever since promotes my services to other people, so now and then I got some work out of it.</p>

			<h1>My future me</h1>
		</div>
		<p>I love my passions and music is one of them. I know that I'm going to play again in an awesome symphony orcestra and I do know that I'm never stop playing double bass and violin. Ther will be always music and ther will always be friends to play with.</p>

		<p>With my crativity I like to help people, I think thats why I wanted to be a designer. Helping people communicating ther ideas in a creative way is something that I very mutch like. Exploring new ideas is somthing I love to do and I always want to be doing only my very best to help. I like to be creative in my work, to be efficient and most impactfull.</p>

		<p>I don't want to stop learning. Taking a challenge is not something I am afraid of. Trying different teqneques to a task is something I like to do. Thats why I think that After Effects and 3D is a nice step forewards in learning new techneques to visualise ideas and different concepts.</p>

			<h1>I’m currently working at Copernica</h1>
		</div>

		<p>I work at a company that enables people to send a ginormous amount of email every day. My task is mostly to create content, design and develop landing pages that are useful and informative, not only for leads but also for customers that use our software. And it is kind of fun when you have powerful marketing automation software at your disposal.</p>

		<p>Sending e-mail is not that hard, the only problem is that people want that their email is read. I learned at Copernica that email can be signed by domain keys with a technology that is called DKIM. In short, DKIM provides a way of validating a domain identity that is associated with a message throughout cryptographic authentication. Also in combination with properly setup SPF records it is possible to send a bulk mailing that is not delivered in any spam box. Although this isn’t the full story, I leant that these standards are a powerful mechanisms to fight spam. DMARC, is combining these technologies and comes with a handy p=reject feature. If this is enabled you can block all email sent by malicious people.</p>

		<p>Although I find the technology fascinating, the marketers are only interested in conversion. Crafting the perfect campaign with powerful personalisation and all the analytics. Yes it’s ‘<a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/email-development-best-practices-2017" target="_blank">fun</a>’ to develop emails with lots of personalisation and follow up actions, but that is not that hard for me anymore. Yes companies need to communicate throughout email with their customers, notify when there is something left in their shopping cart, when their product is expected to arrive, when their subscriptions are ending, offering the right services on time. This is not rocket science, only a little bit of work and a lot of fun to combine human limitations with the logic of computers.</p>

		<p>Email isn’t dead, it’s an easy and cost effective way to inform people in an automated way. Every time a change is made in a database you can program an email campaign around that change. Yes I work at this awesome company, and no this isn’t an advertisement.</p>

			<h1>Graduated</h1>
		</div>

		<p>For my graduation project I was asked to design a tool to persuade parents to choose for a childcare that had a digital parent communication tool. My first idea was to make something like an AirBnB for daycare centres, but soon I learned that this was not a solution for todays society. It is already hard to trust somebody with your house, but it's much harder to trust a stranger with your child.</p>

		<p>After interviewing parents, I found out that parents like to communicate their experiences with their friends and family. Not with everybody, but definitely with their closest friends. The way parents share those memories is very diverse. It did however show that parents share this information to stay in contact with their friends and family. After all, nurturing a baby is hard and time-consuming, and for years the most important task of you and the child’s life.</p>

		<p>Choosing a childcare is not only a rational decision for most parents. For an important part this decision is also very emotionally driven. Out of all my stakeholder interviews I learned that open communication between parents and childcare is very appreciated. Parents like to be with their little loved one(s) and are very protective and careful with their baby. Knowing what and when the baby does something is not just nice to know, but very informative for parents in many ways.</p>

		<p>I successfully graduated at The Hague University of applied sciences with this graduation project. With this project I learned that any design decision can have a big impact but also that testing and validating your decisions is crucial for selling your design. This project is only a idea that has the potential to change a business model, now it needs to be carefully implemented without scaring existing customers away.</p>

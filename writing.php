			<h1>Graduated</h1>

		<p>For my graduation project I was asked to design a tool to persuade parents to choose for a childcare center that had a digital parent communication tool. My first idea was to make something like an AirBnB for daycare centres, but soon I learned that this was not a solution for todays society. It is already hard to trust somebody with your house, but it's much harder to trust a stranger with your child.</p>

			<h1>Seemingly simple and successful products are hard to make</h1>
		</div>

		<p>We like simple apps and services that just work. We don’t ask questions about why it's working, we only ask questions when something is not working. When something is not working, we assume it’s broken. But why are those products hard to make?</p>

		<p>Firstly, simple products are easy to reproduce. Because of this, as soon as you launch a simple product, chances are that everybody will steal your idea and start to make it better. For me, this is the definition of a simple product.</br> Although good products seem simple, the reality of getting the right amount of features to work and create a great user experience is very complex. When all the details are right and the product is delightful to use for everybody, I think you actually can’t speak about a simple product anymore. Someone or a team has been thinking deeply about all those details. Getting all the details right is very important, and a lot of work.</p>

		<p>Designing great user experiences that cover all the different use cases is all about getting your rationale right. Designing isn’t an exact science with one good answer, but with a lot of different answers that do not necessarily tell you if you're right or wrong.</br> There is a lot to learn from many different people, and users are a very important manner to find the best solution for a product. As a designer you have to listen to every stakeholder and weigh every pro against every con to make the best design choices possible.</p>

		<p>User-centered design is however not the only way to come to a solution. For example when conducting interviews for my graduation research with potential users, they didn’t tell me the best solution, because they can’t talk about a feature that doesn't exist. Only their user behaviour was valuable for me.</br> I learned during my internship at Bitcare that prototyping is a great tool to test and communicate ideas with all the different stakeholders. Although I think that methods like rapid prototyping focus too much on the user perspective, prototyping is a very productive and creative tool to explore new features, that can be beneficial to users as well as businesses.</p>

		<p>I like to work for a company that values details and that is only doing its very best to create creative and beautiful products. Details are very important in user experience design. Users will complain, ask for features and services, or leave you if you don’t comply. If you want products and services that are perfect in every detail, you need to design for targeted users. And if you want a product of a service that is successful, you need something that is simpel in the eyes of the users, while at the same time providing a lot of added value and thus being very complex behind the screens.</p>
